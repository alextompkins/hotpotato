# hotpotato
## What is it?
An open-source hot potato game for Android devices. 

## How do I play?
Two main things:

* Firstly, download the app from the Play store or compile it from source here.

* Secondly, the app uses Android's Nearby API, which means you'll need to be close to the people you're playing with (at least in the same room)

Once you're all in a game, one person will have the potato. After a while, this will explode. Don't be the one holding it when it does.
If you have the potato, tilt your phone to move the potato over another player's icon. Hold it there for a short time and it will pass
over to them.

## How many players can it support?
In theory, up to eight players, however that will depend on the host device and how many bluetooth devices it can connect to simultaneously.
Keep in mind that smartwatches, bluetooth headphones, etc. will count towards this cap.

## Known issues
* The potato will occasionally go missing. If you see or hear from any lonely potatoes drifting in space, please let us know.
* Profile photos either work or don't based on a race condition. This may or may not be a bad thing, depending on which selfie you picked.
* Your friends aren't in the same room as you. A possible solution may come in the form of an internet-based potato transferring method.
